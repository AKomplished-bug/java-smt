<p>JavaSMT is a generic API allowing unified access to different SMT solvers.</p>

<p>All the interaction with a solver is performed through the
{@link org.sosy_lab.solver.api.FormulaManager} interface, which encapsulates a
single context.
{@link org.sosy_lab.solver.api.FormulaManager} instances are created using
{@link org.sosy_lab.solver.FormulaManagerFactory}.</p>
