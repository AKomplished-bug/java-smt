In the following the steps to update or change boolector and its JNI are outlined:

There are 2 files, both located in boolector/src/, that need (potential) editing to compile Boolector with JNI:

-interface_wrap.c 	(containing the JNI interface)
-CMakeLists.c 		(the cmakefile)


MakeFile:
CMakeLists.c needs to include ALL JNI .c files you want in its set(libboolector_src_files ...) list at the beginning. (interface_wrap.c should be there!)
Additionally it needs to find the JNI libs and set the path for linking.
Example:

	find_package(JNI)
	if(JNI_FOUND)
  		message (STATUS "JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS=${JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS}")
  		message (STATUS "JNI_LIBRARIES=${JNI_LIBRARIES}")
  		target_include_directories(boolector PRIVATE ${JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS})
  		target_link_libraries(boolector ${JNI_LIBRARIES})
	endif()
	
(should be set and ready to go in the provided version of the cmakefile but here is a copy that should be working if copied in directly before the linking of the SAT solvers)

JNI (interface_wrap.c):
To change or update methods just edit this file! (DON'T CHANGE BOOLECTOR NATIVE CODE!)
The interface is set up with all C API methods (taken from the interfaces via SWIG, see SWIG part at the end of this) of Boolector.
Important: every pointer in Boolector is returned to Java via a Jlong. Just use this as a pointer once given back, but cast it properly!
Be careful, method names need the package in them, see JNI for more details!
There are multiple helper methods at the very end of the file, do not change them unless you know what you are doing!
Since Boolector sometimes writes to given objects, we need those to get the information back to Java. (Explanation via comments in the code)
In case you add new methods, remember to add them to the Java code as well. (Should be BtorJNI.java in the Boolector package)


To compile you need to follow these steps EVERY time since Boolector does not save your preferences:

1. (Optional) Download new Boolector/Update Boolector and edit/create JNI interface and cmakefile
2. Open terminal and switch to the boolector folder (java-smt3-boolector/lib/native/native boolector/boolector)
3. Set up your build (See https://github.com/Boolector/boolector for more information. Important: do not try to include MiniSAT in a shared lib, it won't compile!(October 2019) But check for updates on this!)
	Example:
	./contrib/setup-cadical.sh
	./contrib/setup-lingeling.sh
	./contrib/setup-picosat.sh
	./contrib/setup-btor2tools.sh

4. Build Boolector shared lib (you can add more options if you wish):
	./configure.sh -fno-strict-aliasing -fpic --shared && cd build && make

5. Your shared lib can be found in boolector/build/lib
6. Copy it to java-smt3-boolector/lib/native/x86_64-linux/ and override the old lib
7. Update your JNI Java files


If you choose to use SWIG:
(Careful, you need to check your methods later anyway, SWIG tends to make mistakes. Example: it gives pointers back instead of the object, or a Jlong instead of an Jint etc.)
